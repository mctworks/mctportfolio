				<p>The client needed a website to showcase and sell her artwork. She requested a simple layout that was stylish, but helped to present her art rather than distract from it.</p>
				<p>For simple layout and some features (such as the "sizzle reel" on the front page) Bootstrap was used. For the e-commerce angle, I utilized Stripe's API for payment processing. At the time, the decision was made to not use a "shopping cart" since most of the site's core audience tends to buy no more than one painting at a time. The site does utilize a SQL database for each piece of art in addition to some customer information (strictly for archival purposes; Studio Anni does not save any sensitive information or even anything to use in marketing), and multiple queries are used on the site for each of the different galleries.</p>
				<p>It's probably worth noting that, in addition to all the front-end and back-end work, I also designed the logo for the business, which is still being used, in addition to photo editing some of the art pieces to help showcase them as they look in person.</p>
